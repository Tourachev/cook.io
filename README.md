# cook.io
 Full stack implementation of a UI/UX project.
 
# Problem Statement 
Aging, poorly optimized, and generic blog post style of popular recipe websites make them unapproachable to younger people, deterring them from cooking great meals at home. These blog post style websites do not deliver a clear and easy approach to individuals looking to innovate, learn how to cook or expand their cooking knowledge. 

# Solution
Allows users to browse for cooking recipes. Choose recipe by meal. Add their own and rate the existing ones. The application will contain a user system and a widget that will allow users to add the food that they have at home and suggest recipes based on that. The users are primarily expected to use it via a modern web browser on a mobile platform thus the application will have to have a very intuitive interface on both desktop and mobile devices.
